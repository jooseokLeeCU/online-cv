    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I’m a data scientist with over three years of experience in machine learning, data analytics, and natural language processing, driven by a passion for deploying impactful, data-driven solutions. In my previous role at Netmarble, I developed and implemented a recommendation system for a global mobile game, which increased sales growth rate by 5%, and conducted root cause analysis that resulted in 26% increase of new-user buying rates.  
      I’ve also applied large language models in roles with FINRA and Alliant National Title Insurance, where I used NLP and prompt engineering to streamline complex text data processing.  
        
      Currently, I’m completing a Master’s in Computer Science with a focus on Data Science and Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder, building on my Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering. My expertise spans Python, SQL, Scikit-Learn, Azure, and Google Cloud, and I excel at translating business needs into effective, user-focused data solutions.
